        <p>This is the brisket you want to impress your friends with
            Though a bit more complex than the pork butt, it only takes 
            a couple attempts before you will have the steps down by memory.
            This is brisket, the Texas way! Total cook time around 12 hours.

        <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Full packer brisket</li>
                <li>Mustard (or whatever binder you prefer)</li>
                <li>Krosher salt, Black pepper</li>
                <li>Non-waxed butcher paper</li>
                <li>Sharp boning knife for fat trimming</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Steps:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your smoker to 225F.</li>
                <li>While you smoker is coming up to temp, trim your brisket so that it is smooth and consistant. Get ride of any hard fat and leave a half inch for the fat cap</li>
                <li>Apply your binder, and an even light coat of your salt and pepper rub. We want most of our flavor to come from the smoker. The salt and pepper give us that nice bark.</li>
                <li>Place fat side up on smoker until a nice bark is formed. Usually about 9-10 hours does the trick. Internal temp around 170F.</li>
                <li>Wrap brisket in your butcher paper. Add a little beef tallow or apple cider vinegar for some moisture.</li>
                <li>Once internal temp reaches about 205F, take it off and let it rest for at least 2 hours. The rest is one of the most important parts. Do not skip this step. The longer the rest, the better the brisket.</li>
                <li>Seperate the point from the flat and cut your slices <strong>against the grain</strong> about the width of a pencil.</li>
            </ol>
